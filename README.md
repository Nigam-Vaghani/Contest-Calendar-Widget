Contest Calendar Widget
Problem I Noticed

While regularly participating in competitive programming contests, I realized that keeping track of contest schedules was unnecessarily annoying.

Most of the time, I had to:

Open Codeforces or LeetCode repeatedly

Check which contest is coming

Remember whether it’s Div 2, Div 3, or a LeetCode contest

Keep mental notes about dates and times

Even after checking, I would still forget because the information wasn’t visible where I actually spend my time — the desktop.

I wanted something simple:
A small calendar on my desktop that quietly shows contest days, so I don’t need to think about it.

That’s where this project started.
